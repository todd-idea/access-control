	          		<p>
						Designed for executive leaders in higher education settings, IDEA’s web-based Feedback System for Administrators solicits
						input on 10 pivotal characteristics, representing five distinct administrative roles. The administrator survey tool gathers
						impressions on administrative styles, confidence, and job performance, while also identifying areas for improvement.
						Confidentiality permitting, the respondent sample can be stratified on the basis of a number of roles and relationships.
